Or launch Atom from the [activated virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide.html#activate-script) to get completion for your third-party packages\n* Be sure to check package settings and adjust them. Please read them carefully before creating any new issues\n  * Set path to python executable if package cannot find it automatically\n  * Set extra path if package cannot autocomplete external python libraries\n  * Select one of autocomplete function parameters if you want function arguments to be completed\n\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/193864/11631369/aafb34b4-9d3c-11e5-9a06-e8712a21474e.png)\n\n\n# Common problems\n\n* \"Error: spawn UNKNOWN\" on Windows\n  * Solution: Find your python executable and uncheck the \"Run this program as an administrator\".
